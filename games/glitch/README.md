# Glitch

A singleplayer platformer game for Minetest, created for the
2022 Minetest Game Jam by Wuzzy, featuring music by Visager.

You’re One, a bit who’s lost in cyberspace after a mysterious distortion
interrupts a typical data transmission. Can you figure out what caused
this and get back on track?

Explore the System, collect electrons to unlock new sectors, learn new
abilities to become more powerful and maybe you will find the path to
your true destination.
